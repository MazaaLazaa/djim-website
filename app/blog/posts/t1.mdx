summary: "How I turn NBA data into decisions—shot value, usage dynamics, lineup impact, and opponent scouting—with SQL, Python, and dashboard design."

Basketball is a game of repeated decisions. My work focuses on **turning raw data into clear next steps** for coaches, scouts, and front offices. This post summarizes my approach, the tools I use daily, and the kinds of deliverables I ship.

> **TL;DR**
> - Foundations: possession-based efficiency and the Four Factors  
> - Projects: shot value, consistency tracking, lineup leverage, opponent scout  
> - Deliverables: reproducible SQL/Python, annotated visuals, and plug‑and‑play dashboards

## 1) Skills snapshot

- **Data**: SQL (window functions, CTEs), dbt modeling, schema design  
- **Python**: pandas, NumPy, scikit‑learn (feature engineering & clustering)  
- **Viz**: Tableau / Power BI (stakeholder dashboards), Matplotlib / Altair (custom charts)  
- **Workflow**: Git, notebooks, Make, documentation-first delivery

## 2) Project: Shot value & expected points (player)

**Goal:** quantify where a player creates (or loses) points on the floor.

**Method (condensed):**
1. Build a shot fact table keyed by `player_id, game_id, zone_id`.  
2. Compute zone **make rate**, **attempt share**, and **expected points (EP)** vs. league average.  
3. Visualize a **court heatmap** with EV deltas and add targeted coaching notes.

**What I ship:** a one‑pager with heatmap + bullets like _“+0.12 EP/shot from increasing corner 3 rate by 6%”_.

```text
eFG% = (FGM + 0.5 * 3PM) / FGA
Zone EP = AttemptShare(zone) * [P(make|zone) * PointsForShot]
EP Delta(zone) = EP_player(zone) − EP_league(zone)
