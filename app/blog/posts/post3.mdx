Once you’ve retrieved NBA data from your chosen source, the next challenge is **turning raw data into clean, structured datasets** ready for analysis. Dirty or inconsistent data can lead to misleading results, so this step is critical before building scouting dashboards or predictive models.

---

## 1) Why Cleaning & Modeling Matters

- **Accuracy**: Eliminates errors, missing values, and duplicates.
- **Consistency**: Standardizes formats (e.g., date formats, player names).
- **Efficiency**: Prepares tables for fast querying and joins.
- **Scalability**: Allows the same process to run on multiple seasons or data sources.

---

## 2) Example Data Cleaning Workflow

**Step 1: Import & Inspect**
- Load your raw data into Python (pandas) or SQL.
- Check column names, types, and null values.
- Identify duplicate rows.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load raw shot data
df = pd.read_csv("shots_raw.csv")

# Inspect structure
print(df.info())

# Check missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

**Step 2: Standardize Formats**
- Convert dates to `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Standardize player/team names (merge aliases).
- Convert coordinates (e.g., shot chart `LOC_X`, `LOC_Y`) to feet or defined shot zones.

**Step 3: Handle Missing Data**
- Drop irrelevant rows (e.g., null shot distance for free throws).
- Fill in missing values where logical (e.g., team abbreviations).

**Step 4: Filter & Enrich**
- Add season columns (`2024-25`).
- Tag possessions with play type (PnR, ISO) if available.
- Create derived metrics (e.g., shot zone efficiency, points per possession).

## 3) Modeling the Data

Once cleaned, structure it into **analytics-friendly tables**:

- **Fact Tables**: Shots, possessions, games, lineups.
- **Dimension Tables**: Players, teams, arenas, seasons.

**Example Schema:**

```
fact_shots
- game_id
- player_id
- team_id
- shot_zone
- make_miss
- shot_distance
- points

dim_players
- player_id
- name
- position
- height
- weight
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy joins between tables.
- Supports aggregations (FG% by zone, lineup net rating).
- Reduces duplication and improves query speed.

## 4) Preparing for Scouting Reports

With clean, modeled data, you can:
- Generate **player shot charts** (heatmaps by efficiency or volume).
- Compare **lineup efficiencies** over multiple games.
- Create **opponent Four Factors dashboards** for pre-game prep.
- Build **injury impact models** to estimate replacement value.

---

## 5) Preparing for Predictive Analytics

Clean, structured data enables:
- **Win probability models** using logistic regression.
- **Player similarity scores** using k-means clustering.
- **Expected points models** using gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **Schedule fatigue analysis** incorporating travel and rest days.

## 6) Example End-to-End Workflow

1. **Retrieve**: Pull play-by-play and shot data via [`nba_api`](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) or paid sources.
2. **Store**: Save to PostgreSQL, BigQuery, or Snowflake.
3. **Clean**: Remove duplicates, fix name inconsistencies, standardize formats.
4. **Model**: Create fact & dimension tables with season tagging.
5. **Analyze**: Use SQL/Python to calculate metrics and run models.
6. **Visualize**: Create dashboards in Tableau, Power BI, or Streamlit.
7. **Deliver**: Export scouting PDFs or publish interactive dashboards.
