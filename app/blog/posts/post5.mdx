After setting up a **reproducible NBA analytics pipeline**, the next step is creating dashboards that turn raw stats into instant basketball intelligence.  
The best scouting dashboards go beyond tables — they make patterns *pop*.

## 1) Choosing the Right Visualization for the Right Question

- **Shot Charts (Hexbins / Heatmaps)**: Best for showing shooting efficiency and volume by location.
- **Four Factors Bar Charts**: Visualize team performance in eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, and FT Rate in one glance.
- **Lineup Network Graphs**: Display player combinations and their net ratings.
- **Trend Lines**: Show player or team performance over time (e.g., TS% trend across the season).

## 2) Interactivity = Insight

Static charts are good for reports, but interactive dashboards let analysts:
- Filter by player, opponent, date range.
- Hover for exact stat values.
- Toggle metrics (e.g., FG% vs eFG%).

**Tools for Interactivity**:
- **Tableau / Power BI**: Drag-and-drop interactivity, built-in filters.
- **Plotly Dash / Streamlit**: Custom Python apps with flexible UI components.

## 3) Example Workflow: Player Scouting Dashboard

1. **Data**: Pull shot chart data via `nba_api`.
2. **Process**: Aggregate by shot zone and season split (regular season vs playoffs).
3. **Visualize**:
   - Heatmap of shot efficiency.
   - Line chart of usage rate over time.
   - Four Factors radar chart for player vs league average.
4. **Deliver**: Share interactive link with coaching staff.
