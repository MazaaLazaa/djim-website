# Marketing Campaign Tracker

A centralized view of **paid**, **owned**, and **earned** performance so teams make decisions on the same numbers.

## What it Solves
- Fragmented data across ads, web, and CRM
- Inconsistent attribution assumptions
- Slow, manual reporting cycles

## Approach
1. **Ingestion:** API pulls (ads), GA4 export, and CRM leads/opps
2. **Normalization:** Channel taxonomies + UTM standards
3. **Attribution:** Last‑touch by default with MTA sensitivity checks
4. **QA:** Anomaly detection and source freshness checks

## Views
- Channel overview (CPM, CPC, CPL, CAC, ROAS)
- Creative analysis by message and format
- Funnel drop‑offs (impressions → clicks → MQL → SQL → Win)

## Outcomes
- **+30%** ROI via budget reallocation
- Faster weekly readouts with shareable deep links
